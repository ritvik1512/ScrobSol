ScrobSol
========
A cross-platform plain-c library that allows you to submit scrobbles to
Last.fm using the official Audioscrobbler application, or if that isn't
installed, independently.

The license is BSD, so use it in commercial or open source software as you see
fit.

Usage
=====
This does not compile to a dynamic library. You need to compile it into your
application. Indeed, (on Linux) this is duplication, but it's a very small
amount of code, and we provide many options for which libraries it uses.



Development Notes
=================
Efficiency in memory consumption was prioritised. As a result the code is 
quite unreadable. Sorry about that.
